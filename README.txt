Please do give contribution where it is due

This is a test program that takes a list of email/usernames 
and passwords and automates login for websites. It is unfinished
and I need some help finishing it. If you have some experince with 
python, please take a look at it. I need to take the output 
from two lists, in this case email/username and password, 
and then output it to an html form on a website. The 
rest is hopefully clear in the code itself.
